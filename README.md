# Space  Take Home Assignment

### The Assignment
*Your goal is to create a space 'exploration' iOS application (targeting iPhone and iPad) with react native that will search NASA's Image and Video Library and display the top results.*
1. Use this repo as a starter for your project
	* The repo contains all necessary boilerplate for the project.
	* Fork and clone this repo before beginning your assignment.

2. Local Setup
	* You will need Node, Watchmand, Cocoapods and Xcode.
	* Use `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` to install Homebrew if not previously installed.
	* `brew install node`
	* `brew install watchman`
	* Xcode is available in the MacOS app store.
	* `sudo gem install cocoapods` Using default Ruby install will require `sudo`
	* In project directory run `npm install`
	* In project root open the `ios` directory in Xcode and run the simulator from there.

### Requirements
1.  Functioning iOS application that scales well for any size iOS device.
2.  Ability to search NASA's Image and Video Library using their API.
3.  Display search results (only worry about to 20 results) of images, videos or both for a user to browse.
4.  Allow a user to touch an image or video to either view full size image or play video.

* **Design decisions are all up to you**
